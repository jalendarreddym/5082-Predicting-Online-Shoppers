E-commerce websites are responsible for around 9 percent
of all retail sales that take place in the United States. In point of
fact, businesses like Amazon have established retail empires as
a direct result of operating such massive online marketplaces.
It is vital for businesses that operate in e-commerce industry
to have a good awareness of the dynamics that impact the
client purchase intention in order to be successful given the
competition of the e-commerce platforms and their demand
today.
In addition, the businesses should be able to influence
those dynamics in their favour to increase the likelihood
that potential customers go through with the transactions.
Exploring the online historic purchase data may lead to the
discovery of critical information that, in turn, may lead to
increased sales by influencing customer purchase intent. The
potential of e-commerce to sway the intent of customers to
make a purchase is currently hidden in the data. This is one
of the reasons we felt it would be essential to investigate the
’Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset’ to gain the
insight and predict the purchasing behaviour of customers on
a particular website.
